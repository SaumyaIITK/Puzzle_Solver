Developed a comprehensive program using a pen-paper-based algorithm to effectively solve a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
Executed the recursive backtracking algorithm, thoroughly examined its time complexity, and concurrently deepened insights into the Tree data structure while integrating it into the algorithmic implementation for a deep understanding.
